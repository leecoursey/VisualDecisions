# Visual Decisions

This plugin provides a simple framework for creating and embedding visual decision trees within WordPress. Each diagram is stored as its own custom post type so you can manage them from a dedicated **Visual Decisions** menu in the admin area.

## Features

- **Custom Post Type** `vd_diagram` for storing diagrams.


## Usage

1. Activate the plugin in WordPress.
2. Navigate to **Visual Decisions â†’ Add New** and build your diagram with the D3 editor.
3. Publish the diagram and embed it in any post or page with `[vd_diagram id="123"]`, replacing `123` with the diagram ID.
